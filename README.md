# Bit-to-Bit-RPG-Part-Game
"Bit By Bit" - a nostalgic journey through gaming history, encapsulated in the immersive experience of our game. 

## Overview 

In "Bit By Bit," players take on the role of a young boy seeking an escape from the mundane. The boy, well, let's call him Jeff... Timmy... Ibtihal... Thingy... or even Tchin7a, we couldn't agree on one name X) 

So Jeff was frustrated by the responsibilities of cleaning his room, and stumbling upon his old chest filled with retro video games, he wishes to be a video game character, and to live within the worlds of iconic games from the past, where there are no responsibilities, only games and fun! 

Be careful what you wish for, it might just become true! After his wish, Thingy mysteriously gets sucked into his old console, where he finds himself thrust into the heart of gaming classics: Pong, Pac-Man, Tetris, and so on... BUT, with a twist: Our game offers a unique perspective, allowing players to explore these beloved games from an entirely new point of view.

## Levels 

First of all, we have a small open world where Thingy has to walk around and interact with NPCs (yeah, there's only one...). This will activate some conversation cards, and will get the player to the Levels Menu. 

In Pong (Level 1972, the year Pong was actually created) , Ibtihal has to navigate the center of the screen, poised between the two paddle players, dodging the ball, and waiting for the match to end. Dodging the ball shouldn't be THAT hard, right? The players should just know how to use the arrows on their keyboard. 

In Pac-Man (Level 1980), Tchin7a finds himself inside a maze, using the arrows keys to navigate, collect points and search for an exit to return to reality. Returning to reality will be a good adventure. May you never lose your way in our great maze! One last thing: beware of the ghosts! 

Finally, in Tetris (Level 1984), Timmy is now within the falling blocks, strategically avoiding them (arrows keys) and jumping (space bar) to climb them and ultimately escape the game by reaching the flag at the top. 
This, is the hardest, impossible task, made to keep you inside the box forever! Do you really wanna return to the real world? Stay and dodge the falling blocks walking back and forth, maybe build a tower instead of trying to jump and reach the top.

That's all we have for now XD 



## Relevance to the theme

The theme being "Journey through History: Tales from the Ages", our team has decided to work on the History of VIDEO GAMES specifically. Bit By Bit" - is a nostalgic journey through gaming history. Our character travels from one era of video games to the other with each level (we couldn't possibly get to the 2010s for obvious reasons). 

The name "Bit By Bit" symbolizes the development and evolution of games throughout the ages, where each step forward was achieved one bit at a time.



## Graphic design choice

- Since Jeff gets sucked into a retro video games, we have decided to opt for a pixel art style. 
- The designs and art of the background, characters, textbox, logos and icons were made, at approximately 80%, by us. 



## Sounds and music

- We have also opted for a chill 8bit background music. But this time, we didn't create the music ourselves. 
- Regarding the sound effects, we tried to add a little bit of fun by creating our own sound effects, recorded by us XD


## Explaining the levels' logos

The logos of each game are made to represent the idea of it, first, all three logos are the mirror of the actual ones displayed on dark mode, it's like an 'evil version of the game".

Also, you can see in Pong that Thingy is put inside the O, representing how he's stuck inside the game, 
In Pacman he's about to be eaten by THE Pacman x) 
And in Tetris, Tchin7a is hopping on top of the logo, representing the core mechanic of having to jump through the level to escape 


## Added value and impact 

Nostalgia, timeline of video games, a fresh rendition on well-known games and mechanics for fun.
